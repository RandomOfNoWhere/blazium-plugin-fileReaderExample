Just a simple plugin to create a one button dock, that reads a file when said button is clicked

 - You will need to change the path var in the my_dock.gd file to match the location where you have stored your file
   
Thanks to @WhalesState, and @jss2a98aj for helping sort out the issue I was having with getting the button to fire correctly!
