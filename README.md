Just a simple plugin to create a one button dock, that reads a file when said button is clicked

 - You will need to change the path var in the my_dock.gd file to match the location where you have stored your file 
 - Thanks to:
   - The Blazium dev team
   - @WhalesState, and @jss2a98aj sorting out the issue with the button not firing correctly!
